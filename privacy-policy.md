Six things you can do now to improve your CV:

When preparing the CV, the main objective remains: to create a positive impact on the reader and motivate him to communicate and offer job opportunities.

Through exposure to thousands of CVs, we found that there are some techniques that can be used that help develop the CV and make it more effective, impactful and able to stand out among the many CVs submitted for the same job opportunities.

In this article, we will give you 6 things that you can modify or add to improve your resume and give it a professional look.

Personal statement :

A personal statement is one of the most important defining elements of your personality and the first keys to knowing your future directions and past experiences, so writing it correctly will reflect positively on the recruitment process.

Keep it short, focus on keywords, mention your strengths, and if you need help, ask a colleague or friend about your strengths.

Mention accomplishments, not routines :

Use clear, strong language that focuses on your accomplishments in your previous work, not just the regular jobs and issues that are repeated in most resumes, so describe the exceptional accomplishments you have achieved over the past years.

And remember that the achievement is not always linked to large numbers or the publication of newspaper results, it is possible that the development of a new policy in the company led to higher results than the previous one.

Focus on keywords :

Each field has its own keywords, for example in the field of marketing you will see words such as (campaigns, content marketing, product development, return on investment, user journey) and many other terms that fall within the core of the work, so the more accurate you are in these terms The more professional your CV becomes and expresses a deep understanding of the field.

Make it targeted and customized :

We all know that mentioning all the different works that a person has done in the past is attractive to companies because it indicates that the person has expertise in many fields, but unfortunately this is not what companies are looking for most of the time and it may indicate that the person is not a specialist or expert in A specific area and can make an important difference within it.

Therefore, we recommend focusing on a specific field or specialty that is included in the CV in ascending order that shows the process of development formed year after year, then your chances will be higher in positions you have a long balance and focused experience to work in.

Use numbers and statistics:

Metrics vary naturally between humans, so the concept of “big” for example may differ between each individual, and this applies to previous achievements, what you may see as important work others may see as normal, so include your results with numbers and statistics and stay away from narrative description and broad terms.

If you were in charge of the recruitment department previously, do not say “I hired a large number of workers” and replace it with “ I contributed to interviewing and hiring 240 workers in two years " .

List your volunteer work :

Volunteer work is very important for the person’s skills through it, so put it in a special section in which you explain your experience in volunteer work in the same way that you explain your experience in the field of work, and focus on the skills you acquired from these works, which may be soft skills such as communication Organizing and managing teams.
